## Microservices & Cloud Computing (CSC 5201) - Healthcare Management System - Final Project

In Progress.

Project Overview:
A microservices-based application for managing healthcare data and services. The application encompasses various modules, including patient management, appointment scheduling, and medical records management, all designed using a microservices architecture with REST APIs for communication.

App Design: 
1. GUI Service: Provides the user interface for interaction with the system, including views for patient management, appointment scheduling, and medical records.
2. Medical Records Service: Manages the creation, modification, and retrieval of medical records.
3. Patient Management Service: Handles patient data management and integrates a machine learning model for risk prediction
4. Appointment Scheduler Service: Manages scheduling of appointments and coordinates times between patients and healthcare providers.
5. Data & Training Scripts for Patient Risk prediction contains the training dataset and scripts necessary to train and serialize the ML model used in patient management.
Platform used to deploy the app is DigitalOcean Droplet and Docker Compose is utilized to manage the containerization of services, allowing for easy deployment and scaling.
